# SableyeBot
### Competitive Pokemon Discord bot

## [Add SableyeBot to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=211522070620667905&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

## Installation
SableyeBot requires NodeJS 10+. In order to run your own local copy of SableyeBot, you need to perform a few steps.

1. Clone this repository, including the entire [Pokemon-Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown) repository.
2. Rename `config.js.example` to `config.js` and fill out the empty fields and/or change the default values.
3. Go into the Pokemon-Showdown repository and run `npm run build`

If the steps above are performed correctly, you should be able to run `node index.js` and the bot will launch.

Yes, these instructions hurt my soul too. But it's easy and it works...
